Electrical Overview
--------------------

Mobility Layer
++++++++++++++++++++

Input Voltage: 30 - 42.5V

This layer has a circuit board with an STM32 microcontroller. It has the following functions:

- Control 4 servomotor drives and recieve position feedback
- Recieve data from 5 TOF sensor modules using I2C 
- Control the lifter motor
- Recieve relay signal from romote module
- Output emergency stop signal to UR5
- Communicate isolatedly with on-board computer using CAN

Battery Layer
++++++++++++++++++++
Output Voltage: 36V 

This layer has two batteries; one is for on-board computer and the other one is for Mobility Layer and UR5 motor.

Computer Layer
++++++++++++++++++++

Input Voltage: 30 - 42.5V

This layer has the following major components:

- SD-1000-12: This is a power module that outputs 12V DC for on-board computer, UR5 controller and some other parts
- SD-1000-48: This is another power module that outputs 12V DC for the UR5 motor drives
- Interface of on-board computer with DP, WLAN, USB 3.0 and other ports
- Interface of UR5 controller with DB9 (for mouse and keyboard) display ports
	

Lifter
++++++++++++++++++++

It uses a 24V brushless DC motor and has an infrared TOF sensor to measure the current height of the lifter.

Arm
++++++++++++++++++++

The arm on MOMA is UR5, a product of Universal Robots. Specifications of UR5 are available through this link: (https://www.universal-robots.com/media/1514597/101081_199901_ur5_technical_details_web_a4_art03_rls_eng.pdf)

Hand
++++++++++++++++++++

- 6V 10A power supply
- CAN Communication (for more details, see the datasheet of ADM3053)
- STM32F405 microcontroller that controls 12 servomotors, receives data from tactile sensor boards and communicates with the on-board computer
