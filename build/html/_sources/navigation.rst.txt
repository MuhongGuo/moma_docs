Navigation Tutorial
====================

MOMA is shipped with configurations of `ROS Navigation Stack <http://wiki.ros.org/navigation>`_. 
You can find those configuration files in /home/moma/moma/moma_ros/src/moma_tutorials/moma_navigation/moma_2dnav.

Build a Map
------------

When building a map, using only one lidar of MOMA is enough. 
You can choose gmapping to do this work:
::

  $ rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=base_scan_leftfront

or

::

  $ rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=base_scan_rightback

After mapping, you can save the map using `map_server <http://wiki.ros.org/map_server>`_:

::

  $ rosrun map_server map_saver -f mapname

This command will save the map at the location where the command is runned.

Navigation
------------

After building a map, you can load the map with:

::

  rosrun map_server map_server mymap.yaml

The mymap.yaml should be at the location where the command runs.

Now you can do navigation with:

:: 

  $ roslaunch moma_2dnav move_base.launch

Draw a goal on RVIZ, and see the actions of MOMA. **Don't forget to grasp the industrial controller in hand.**
