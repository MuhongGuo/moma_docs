Visualization Turtorial
========================

You can visualize MOMA on it's internal computer with RVIZ:
::

  $ roslaunch moma_bringup moma_visualization

.. figure:: _static/visualization/visualization.png
   :align: center
   :figclass: align-centered

If you want to see the visualization on a remote computer, 
you can follow the :ref:`network` section to config your computer.

However, please note that it is very hard to transmit camera data from one computer to another. 
If you really need to monitor what the cameras on MOMA are seeing on a remote computer, 
it is recommended to use `NoMachine <https://www.nomachine.com/>`_ in a LAN or 
`Teamviewer <https://www.teamviewer.com/en/>`_.
