Software Overview
=================

Environment
-----------

MOMA's internal computer runs Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS and ROS indigo, which largely 
gives the system compatibility and stability. 

At the first time to access the internal computer, 
you are recommended to connect a keyboard, mouse and HDMI monitor to the side shell of MOMA.

There is an account with username *moma* in the computer. The password by default is also moma, 
which is recommended to change when you get MOMA.

Network
-------

Now you can change the network setting. It is recommended to connect MOMA with Wi-Fi so that 
you can still monitor the activities inside MOMA while it is moving around. 

There are three network interfaces on MOMA's computer. Apart from those two (**wlan2 and eth1**) on MOMA's shell, 
the other one (**eth0**) is used to connect with UR5, where the IP of UR5 Is 10.0.0.250 and the IP of MOMA 
is 10.0.0.3.

If you want to connect a remote computer to the ROS master running on MOMA, you can 
config your computer with these commands in terminal:

::

  $ echo export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://IP_OF_MOMA:11311 >> ~/.bashrc
  $ echo export ROS_HOSTNAME=IP_OF_PC >> ~/.bashrc


Upstart service
---------------

There is a service running right after the internal computer starts up. 
This service creates a listener to the trigger of this combination on XBOX One controller: 
**Left Trigger + Right Trigger + Left Bumper + Right Bumper + Guide**. 
Once the event is occured, this service will launch the drivers of all actuators on MOMA and a 
teleoperation program to control them.

The service's name is *moma*. To stop or start this service manually, you can use the commands below:

::

  $ sudo service moma stop
  $ sudo service moma start
