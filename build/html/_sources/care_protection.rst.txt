Care and Protection
===================

Battery
-----------

- When the voltage of a bettery is below 34 V, it is time to replace it. The battery for PC is always the first one running out. So take more care of it.

Arm
----

- Keep the center of gravity over lifter.

- Don't push and pull the arm when you want to move MOMA. You can push mobile base instead.


RGB-D Cameras
---------------

- Protect the Realsense SR300 and the Kinect v2 on MOMA from any obstacles.
