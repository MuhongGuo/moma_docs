Document Outline (TEMPORARY)
============================

Since the readers of this document would mainly be undergraduate and graduated students, 
who may not have much experience and knowledge of working with robot, 
it will be helpful to attach links of reference for them. 

This document should be written to introduce how to use MOMA, instead of how to design it.
Thus it is unnecessary to include much details.
Nonetheless, there should be enough information to support readers' work.

Always start from usage. Consider as many scenarios as possible, 
especially when we are writing *Safty* and *Care and Protection* section.

"Talk is cheap, show me your code." Using other forms, such as picture, graph, video, 
always help to understand.


Quick Start
-----------
- Brief Introduction of MOMA

  Global basic information. What is MOMA? What is it for? What can it do?

- How to run MOMA

  Start from receiving a new MOMA, introduce how to run it up step by step.
