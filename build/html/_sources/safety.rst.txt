Safety
======

Since the robot doesn't have any consciousness, it just performs commands 
from program, you should always garuantee you can press E-STOP button anytime 
the robot is moving. **Remember**:

.. note::

  **Don't trust any program, trust E-STOP.**

Mobile Base
------------

- The mobile base is designed to move on **only** plane ground. So keep its workspace clean without any cables or screws, etc.

- If your program cannot let MOMA respond to obstacles at a high frequency, always keep it at a low speed.

Lifter
------

- Watch out the top of mobile base when the lifter is going down. Otherwise the shell of lifter may crush something.

- Watch out the arm when the lifter is going up and make sure it won't hit something.

Arm
-------

- Always let MOMA know what is around it and give it the ability to move without collision, otherwise keep its workspace empty.

- Limit the velocity and effort of the arm's joints if you don't have the confidence on your code.



Electricity
-------------

- When MOMA is going to use external power source, make sure the voltage is around 36V before you set the Power Switch.

- If you found any wire broken, don't continue using MOMA. Shut it down and contact Dorabot Inc.

Others
-------

- Don't try to carry MOMA up. If you really need to do that, uninstall the sells on mobility layer first, and ask three men to help you.
