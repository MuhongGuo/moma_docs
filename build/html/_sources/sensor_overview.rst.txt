Sensor Overview
------------------------

TOF ranging Sensor
++++++++++++++++++++

On each side of MOMA's mobile base, there is a TOF ranging sensor measuring 
the distance to the objects in the front of it. The maximum range of these sensors is 2m. 
More information about that can be found `here <http://www.st.com/en/imaging-and-photonics-solutions/vl53l0x.html>`_.

Bumper
++++++++

The bumper attached along the edges of MOMA's mobility layer can be treated as 
a switcher. When the bumper is pressed when MOMA collides with an obstacle, 
the bumper output a signal and the mobile base will stop to avoid further damage.


Encoder
++++++++

The encoder of the four motors on mobile base is used to calculate the odom information, 
that is the 2D pose of MOMA.
 

Lidar
++++++



MOMA is equipped with two URG-04, the range of which is 5600mmx240 degree. One is in the left-front side
of MOMA, and the other is right-back. 
You can go to this `website <https://www.hokuyo-aut.jp/search/single.php?serial=166>`_ to know more about them.

Kinect V2
++++++++++

There is a very famous RGB-D camera, `Kinect V2 <https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/kinect>`_ on MOMA's lifter. 
See :ref:`kinect_v2_interface` to know how to get data from it.


Realsense SR300
++++++++++++++++

MOMA's hand is mounted with a Realsense SR300. This is an indoor-used RGB-D camera, 
with range from 0.2m to 1.5m. You can refer to this `article <https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05548>`_ 
to know more about Intel Realsense product.

If the Realsense SR300 and the Kinect V2 are all turned on and watching the same objects, 
you will find the performance of Realsense SR300 is dramatically decreased. 
You can go to `this website <https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/v1.12.1/doc/camera_specs.md#f200--sr300-notes>`_ 
to know about the reason.


Proximity Sensor
++++++++++++++++++

The `proximity sensors <https://www.vishay.com/docs/83395/vcnl4000_demo_kit.pdf>`_ on MOMA's hand measure the distance to objects in the front. 
The maximum range is about 5cm.

Angle Sensor
++++++++++++++

The angle sensor on MOMA's hand measure the position of each joints on fingers. 
Check :ref:`hand_interface` to know how to get the data of angle sensors. 

Microphone
++++++++++

The microphone on MOMA is a `MXL AC-404 <http://www.mxlmics.com/microphones/web-conferencing/AC-404/>`_. 
This is a also the one `that was used on PR2 <http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/PR2/HardwareMods#Microphones_.28ears.29_for_the_PR2_head>`_.
