What are on MOMA
----------------

Let's first get to know some MOMA's components that you need when you want to use it.
Power Switch, PC Button, UR5 Button and E-STOP Button:

   :align: center
   :figclass: align-centered

The Power Switch of MOMA has three channels of power source:

========  ======================
Channel   Power Source
========  ======================
\-         Batteries
o         None
=         External Power Source
========  ======================

MOMA needs two 36V batteries for power. One is for PC and UR5 control board, the other battery is for the rest. 
Here you can see the real-time voltage of batteries:

HDMI Interface, USB 3.0 Interface, Wi-Fi Antenna Interface and Ethernet Interface:

Turn on MOMA
------------

Since MOMA is shipped with Batteries, you can turn on MOMA by setting the Power Switch to 
the "-" position and pressing the PC Button and UR5 Button.

Operate MOMA
-------------

You may not statisfy with just lighting those buttons. Let's move forward to operate MOMA.

Release E-STOP Buttons
++++++++++++++++++++++

There are two E-STOP Buttons controlling MOMA. It is very easy to find them, because they are all red. 
One is on the mobile base, the other is on the 
industrial controller. By pressing these buttons, any actions performing on arm and mobile base will terminate, 
and no more commands will affect it. MOMA is shipped with those buttons pressed. So to operate MOMA, 
you need to twist those buttons clock-wise to release them. But just releasing E-STOP buttons is not 
enough to control the robot, you should then press the Start Button **twice** to enable mobile base and UR5. 
Pressing more times dosen't not hurt, so form a habit that always pressing the this button multiple times before 
you want to control MOMA.

Initialize UR5
++++++++++++++

Since the joints of UR5 need to be initialized to find there positions, you have to do this initialization 
before you start to use it. Please go through this `article <http://www.zacobria.com/universal-robots-zacobria-forum-hints-tips-how-to/turn-on-power/>`_ to know how this process goes. 


XBOX One Wireless Controller
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now you have prepare all the things needed to operate MOMA. 
Please pick up XBOX One controller and start to do some fancy stuffs.


.. warning::

  First, garuantee the industrial controller is within your reach. 
  Ideally, as long as MOMA is going to move, 
  you should alway put your thumb over the E-STOP button of industrial controller 
  so that you can stop MOMA immediately when something terrible is to happen. 
  But because we have to use both of our hands in some case of teleopeation, you can keep the 
  industrial controller nearby.

Here is the layout of XBOX One controller:

The next step is to bring up drivers of all the actuators on MOMA by pressing 
this combination of buttons at the same time: 

::

  Left Trigger + Right Trigger + Left Bumper + Right Bumper + Guide

And you need to know how to control each component of MOMA:

Mobile Base
###########

When controlling the mobile base, please keep pressing **Left Trigger** and 
follow the instruction below to perform different actions:

======================    ==============================
Controller                Mobile Base
======================    ==============================
Left Stick up/down        Move forward/backward
Left Stick left/right     Move left/right
Right Stick left/right    Turn left/right
Button Y                  Increase linear velocity
Button A                  Decrease linear velocity
Button X                  Increase angular velocity
Button B                  Decrease angular velocity
======================    ==============================

.. warning::

  Since there is no 2d collision checking and the acceleration is limited to a small value 
  when teleoperate the mobile base with XBox One Controller, you should be careful not to 
  let MOMA hit anything.

.. warning::

  Since the mobile base is designed to move only on plane ground, you should keep its workspace clean 
  without any cables or screws, etc.


Hand
####

When controlling the hand, please keep pressing **Right Trigger** and 
follow the instruction below to perform different actions:

=============================    ================================================
Controller                       Hand
=============================    ================================================
Button Y + Left Stick up/down    Grasp/Release with three fingers
Button B + Left Stick up/down    Grasp/Release with three fingers
Button A + Left Stick up/down    Grasp/Release with three fingers
Right Stick up/down              Move the pan joints of the two fingers on sides
Back                             Seperate fingers
Start                            Get fingers together
=============================    ================================================

Arm
######

When controlling the arm, please keep pressing **Left Bumper** and 
follow the instruction below to perform different actions:

=================================     ===========================
Controller                            Arm
=================================     ===========================
Button Y + Left Stick up/down         Move shoulder_pan_joint
Button Y + Left Stick left/right      Move shoulder_lift_joint
Button B + Left Stick up/down         Move elbow_joint
Button B + Left Stick left/right      Move wrist_1_joint
Button A + Left Stick up/down         Move wrist_2_joint
Button A + Left Stick left/right      Move wrist_3_joint
Button Y + Right Stick up/down        Move EE along x axis
Button Y + Right Stick left/right     Turn EE around x axis
Button B + Right Stick up/down        Move EE along y axis
Button B + Right Stick left/right     Turn EE around y axis
Button A + Right Stick up/down        Move EE along z axis
Button A + Right Stick left/right     Turn EE around z axis
=================================     ===========================

.. warning::

  Please be careful when you are controlling UR5 with XBOX One Controller, 
  because there is no any collision checking and the arm may collide with itself or others. 
  What's more, you should be very anxious when the arm is moving to its singularities, where 
  the speed of the arm's movement will become very fast.

Lifter
######

When controlling the lifter, please keep pressing **Right Bumper** and 
follow the instruction below to perform different actions:

==========    ==========
Controller    Lifter
==========    ==========
Button Y      Move up
Button A      Move down
==========    ==========

Have fun with operating MOMA!
